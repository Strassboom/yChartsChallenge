Enter 'python main.py inPath outPath' where inPath is a path to the file from which you want to read input, and outPath is the path to which you would like to write the results of the program running.

Leaving both inPath and outPath blank defaults them to recon.in and recon.out in the current workspace.
Including only inPath defaults outPath to recon.in in the current workspace.
